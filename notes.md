# My Implementation

This is how I intend to implement the RSA Factoring challenge.

### Program Structure

1. **Read Input from File**: Read a file containing one natural number per line.
2. **Factor Each Number**: Use a simple method (like trial division) to find two factors for each number.
3. **Output the Result**: Print the results in the specified format.

### Pseudo-code

Here's a structured pseudo-code for your program:

```pseudocode
function main():
    filename = getCommandLineArgument()  // Get the file name from command line
    numbers = readNumbersFromFile(filename)  // Read numbers from file
    for n in numbers:
        p, q = factor(n)  // Factor the number
        if p is not None and q is not None:
            print(n + "=" + p + "*" + q)  // Print in the required format

function readNumbersFromFile(filename):
    open file filename for reading
    numbers = []
    for each line in file:
        n = integer(line.strip())  // Convert line to integer
        numbers.append(n)  // Add to the list
    return numbers

function factor(n):
    // Attempt trial division up to sqrt(n)
    for i from 2 to floor(sqrt(n)):
        if n % i == 0:  // If i is a factor
            p = i
            q = n / i  // Calculate the corresponding factor
            return (p, q)  // Return the factors
    return (None, None)  // Return None if no factors found

// Start the program
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()  // Call the main function
```

### Detailed Steps

1. **Command-Line Argument Handling**:
   - Ensure that the program accepts a filename as a command-line argument. This allows the user to specify which file to read.

2. **Reading Numbers**:
   - Open the specified file in read mode.
   - Read each line, strip whitespace, and convert it to an integer. Store these integers in a list.

3. **Factorization Logic**:
   - Use trial division:
     - Loop from 2 to the integer value of the square root of \( n \).
     - For each integer \( i \), check if it divides \( n \) evenly. If it does, calculate the other factor \( q \) as \( n / i \).
     - Return the factors as soon as you find them.

4. **Output Formatting**:
   - Print the results in the format `n=p*q` for each number.

### Example Implementation in Python

Here’s how the above logic could be implemented in Python:

```python
import sys
import math

def main():
    if len(sys.argv) != 2:
        print("Usage: factors <file>")
        return

    filename = sys.argv[1]
    numbers = read_numbers_from_file(filename)
    
    for n in numbers:
        p, q = factor(n)
        if p is not None and q is not None:
            print(f"{n}={p}*{q}")

def read_numbers_from_file(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        return [int(line.strip()) for line in file]

def factor(n):
    for i in range(2, int(math.isqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            p = i
            q = n // p
            return (p, q)
    return (None, None)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Running the Program

1. **Compilation/Execution**: If you’re using Python, ensure it’s installed on the machine. You can run the script directly:
   ```
   python factors.py input_file.txt
   ```

2. **Input File Format**: Ensure your input file follows the specified format (one number per line, no spaces).

### Additional Considerations

- **Time Efficiency**: The trial division method is effective for smaller numbers but may become slow for larger inputs. If necessary, consider implementing more sophisticated methods.
- **Error Handling**: Make sure to include error handling for file operations, such as handling non-existent files.
