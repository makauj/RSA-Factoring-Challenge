# RSA Factoring Challenge

This is my attempt at completing the RSA factoring challenge.

This project will involve writing a program to factorize numbers, which is a fundamental aspect of breaking RSA encryption. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Understand the Basics
RSA encryption relies on the difficulty of factoring large composite numbers. The public key is a product of two large prime numbers, and the private key is derived from these primes. Your task is to factorize the composite number to find these primes.

### Step 2: Set Up Your Environment
Make sure you have a development environment set up. You can use any programming language, but for simplicity, let's use Python.

### Step 3: Write the Factorization Function
Here's a basic Python function to factorize a number:

```python
def factorize(n):
    factors = []
    divisor = 2
    while n > 1:
        while n % divisor == 0:
            factors.append(divisor)
            n //= divisor
        divisor += 1
    return factors
```

### Step 4: Test Your Function
Create a list of numbers to factorize and test the function:

```python
numbers_to_factor = [15, 21, 33, 77, 143]
for number in numbers_to_factor:
    print(f"{number} = {factorize(number)}")
```

### Step 5: Optimize for Larger Numbers
For larger numbers, you might need a more efficient algorithm. One common method is the Pollard's rho algorithm. Here's a simple implementation:

```python
import math
import random

def pollards_rho(n):
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return 2
    x = random.randint(2, n - 1)
    y = x
    c = random.randint(1, n - 1)
    d = 1
    while d == 1:
        x = (x * x + c) % n
        y = (y * y + c) % n
        y = (y * y + c) % n
        d = math.gcd(abs(x - y), n)
    return d

def factorize_large(n):
    factors = []
    while n > 1:
        factor = pollards_rho(n)
        factors.append(factor)
        n //= factor
    return factors
```

### Step 6: Test with Larger Numbers
Test your optimized function with larger numbers:

```python
large_numbers_to_factor = [10403, 104729, 1299709]
for number in large_numbers_to_factor:
    print(f"{number} = {factorize_large(number)}")
```

### Step 7: Handle Edge Cases
Make sure to handle edge cases, such as prime numbers and very large numbers.

### Step 8: Document Your Code
Write clear documentation and comments to explain how your code works.

### Step 9: Explore Further
You can explore more advanced algorithms and optimizations, such as the Quadratic Sieve or the General Number Field Sieve, for even larger numbers.

### Step 10: Share Your Project
Consider sharing your project on platforms like GitHub to get feedback and contributions from others.
